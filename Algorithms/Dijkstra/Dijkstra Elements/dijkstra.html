            <h1>Dijkstra's Algorithm: Step-by-Step Process</h1>

            <h2>What is Dijkstra's Algorithm?</h2>
            <p>Dijkstra's algorithm is used to find the shortest path from a single source node to all other nodes in a weighted graph. It is commonly used in network routing and mapping applications where you need to determine the shortest route between two points.</p>

            <h2>How the Algorithm Works</h2>
            <p>Dijkstra's algorithm works by maintaining a set of nodes whose shortest distance from the source node is known. It iteratively selects the node with the smallest tentative distance, explores its neighbors, and updates their distances if a shorter path is found.</p>

            <h2>Algorithm Example</h2>
            <p>Let's go through a simple example using a graph with 6 nodes and the following edges:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>A - B (4)</li>
                <li>A - C (2)</li>
                <li>B - C (5)</li>
                <li>B - D (10)</li>
                <li>C - E (3)</li>
                <li>D - F (11)</li>
                <li>E - D (4)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Step 1:</h3>
            <p>Start from Node 0 and mark Node as visited as you can check in below image visited Node is marked red. </p>

            <div class="step-visualization">
                <p>Graph after initialization:</p>

            </div>

            <h3>Step 2: </h3>
            <p>Check for adjacent Nodes, Now we have to choices (Either choose Node1 with distance 2 or either choose Node 2 with distance 6 ) and choose Node with minimum distance. In this step Node 1 is Minimum distance adjacent Node, so marked it as visited and add up the distance.</p>

            <div class="step-visualization">
               
                <img src="step2.png" alt="Step 2 Visualization">
            </div>

            <h3>Step 3:</h3>
            <p>Then Move Forward and check for adjacent Node which is Node 3, so marked it as visited and add up the distance, Now the distance will be:</p>

            <div class="step-visualization">
               
                <img src="step3.jpg" alt="Step 3 Visualization">
            </div>

            <h3>Step 4:</h3>
            <p>Again we have two choices for adjacent Nodes (Either we can choose Node 4 with distance 10 or either we can choose Node 5 with distance 15) so choose Node with minimum distance. In this step Node 4 is Minimum distance adjacent Node, so marked it as visited and add up the distance. </p>

            <div class="step-visualization">
                
                <img src="step4.png" alt="Step 3 Visualization">
            </div>

            <h3>Step 5:</h3>
            <p>Again, Move Forward and check for adjacent Node which is Node 6, so marked it as visited and add up the distance, Now the distance will be:</p>

            <div class="step-visualization">
                
                <img src="step5.png" alt="Step 3 Visualization">
            </div>

            

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>By following these steps, Dijkstra's algorithm determines the shortest path from the source node to all other nodes in the graph. It is efficient for graphs without negative weights.</p>
